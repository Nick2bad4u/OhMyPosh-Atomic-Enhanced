# Starship config generated to approximate:
#   OhMyPosh-Atomic-Custom-ExperimentalDividers.json
#
# Notes/limitations (Starship vs OMP):
# - No OMP-style `background_templates` per-segment; per-shell coloring is approximated via the `shell` module indicators.
# - No OMP tooltips, min_width, or divider gradients.
# - “Sysinfo” (CPU/Disk %) + Copilot gauge are not built-ins; see optional `custom.sysinfo` below.
# - Weather: Starship has no built-in OWM module. You can approximate it via `custom.weather`.
#
# Advanced features you can enable outside this TOML (from https://starship.rs/advanced-config/):
# - PowerShell transient prompt:
#     Invoke-Expression (&starship init powershell)
#     Enable-TransientPrompt
# - Cmd (Clink) transient prompt:
#     clink set prompt.transient always
#     (then edit starship.lua per docs)
# - Bash right prompt requires ble.sh v0.4+ (Starship docs).
# - Window title hooks require shell-specific init (PowerShell Invoke-Starship-PreCommand, etc.)
#
# Usage:
#   - Copy/rename to %USERPROFILE%\.config\starship.toml (or wherever Starship reads it)
#   - Ensure you’re using a Nerd Font.
